# Stanwood Architecture Navigation

We handle navigation by means of the [Navigation Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/). 

This library provides helper classes for simplified and more consistent navigation handling. This is mainly used by the IntelliJ plugin.
